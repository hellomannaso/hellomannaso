talk about the growing popularity of tennis. 
Various outdoor activities became popular during the three years of the COVID 19 pandemic. 
Among them tennis is steadily rising in popularity.

You can especially feel its popularity among younger generations in their 20s and 30s. 
The tennis gear that they use mostly comes in all different colors. 
This means there are plenty of photo opportunities for young users to post on I.

I think it's great that this has expanded the base of tennis players. 
There is a prejudice that only people with lots of experience can play tennis but these days there are plenty of indoor and outdoor courts where first timers can easily join I.

They are good news for people just getting into the sport. 
If you can't find a court or a coach for lessons you can always watch tutorial videos posted on YouTube by former players.
