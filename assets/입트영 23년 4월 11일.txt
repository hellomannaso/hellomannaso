Tuesday April 11th talk about lessons that can be learned from playing board games. 
I started playing board games as a way to have fun with my four year old daughter. 
I sensed that she was highly competitive so I played with her every chance I got to teach her how to manage her feelings.

There was so much to teach her as we played board games first, you must play the game fair and square. 
Second, you must learn to study yourself when victory is within reach but you end up back at square one.

You shouldn't hold it against your opponent when you are unexpectedly attacked. 
These lessons were but a few of many they are hard lessons to teach a child. 
But for 8 years now we've played board games to wind down the day

when she grows up I plan to ask her whether mom and dad's secret intentions had any effect.

It's a great way to spend some time together as a family

I think it's also a good way for kids to indirectly experience what life is like in the real world.

That's right that's why we always try to make time for them.
