Thursday April 20th talk about stem cell transplants. 
Stem cell transplantation is a treatment to save patients suffering from afflictions like leukemia. 
In the past it was known as a bone marrow transplant because the cells were taken from bone marrow

but cell collection methods have changed thanks to medical advances and stem cell transplant is now the correct terminology. 
The donor receives an injection to stimulate the production of stem cells in their body.

The transplant is then completed by collecting just the stem cells and transplanting them in the patient can be seen as a type of apheresis blood donation. 
It only works on the condition that DNA of the patient and donor are a close match.

The donor registration process is pretty straightforward. 
You visit a local blood bank and declare your intention to donate then you simply wait until there is a patient who is a match. 
Dialogue practice
