Tuesday April 18th talk about looking after your beloved baby. 
We were overjoyed when our baby was born but when we stepped out of the postnatal care center, we didn't even know where to begin. 
We had to breastfeed the baby every two hours so my wife couldn't get a good night's sleep.

We used a breast pump to store milk before sleeping and bottle fed our baby so that my wife could at least get some shut eye. 
Also I was in charge of bathing the baby. 
It was always a nerve racking experience because the baby couldn't keep his head up.

Our son is now 32 months old. 
He goes to bed at 9 PM and wakes up at 7 in the morning seeing him take his first steps and eventually run around was a precious once in a lifetime experience. 
Our baby is our angel. 
Of course that goes double when he's asleep. 
Dialogue, practice

I feel most rewarded when I see him fast asleep.
