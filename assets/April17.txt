Monday April 17th talk about a cashless society. 
Ever since a few years ago, I have rarely carried cash. 
It's not just at the workplace. 
I use my credit card for leisure activities too. 
I only withdraw cash at an ATM when I attend a wedding or a funeral or when I give my parents pocket money.

Even my parents, who are both in their late 70s, say they pay in cash much less frequently. 
They mostly use debit cards or credit cards. 
If even the elderly use cash less like my parents I believe cash must be on its last legs.

All over the world fewer and fewer businesses are accepting cash. 
The number of ATMs and bank branches is also sharply declining. 
Mobile banking services provided by the financial sector and various digital payment solutions from big tech companies are becoming more common.

I feel like we are edging toward a cashless society.
