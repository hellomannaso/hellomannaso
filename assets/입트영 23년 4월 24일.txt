talk about waiting for a baby. 
We are a newly wed couple in our early 30s. 
We tied the knot almost two years ago. 
Now we are waiting for a beautiful baby. 
Honestly my husband and I both thought that we would be able to conceive right away if we put our minds to it

but as we started to prepare, we realized we were sorely mistaken. 
As we try to conceive my husband and I are taking health supplements and working out regularly. 
The longer we wait for our baby, the harder it becomes. 
People we know tell us to take it slow

but it's not so easy to be laid back about I. 
I hope that everyone waiting for a baby, ourselves I, will have their wish granted soon.

We've been trying to conceive since last year. 
We've had no luck so far.

I can't wait to deliver a baby that takes after both of.
