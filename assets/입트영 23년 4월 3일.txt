Monday April 3rd


talk about cleaning up your home. 
I am a working mom with four year old twins. 
I had been putting off cleaning the house for one reason or another because I was always so tired but one day it felt like the house had become a giant warehouse.

So one weekend I put my husband in charge of the kids at a kids cafe and got to work giving the house a proper clean up. 
Besides the kid's toys, a lot of my own things were sitting around gathering dust too. 
I started to throw away various odds and ends


if something was in good shape I set them aside and posted them on a second hand trade APP. 
After spending a few weekends tidying up around the house this way we started to free up extra space.


What's more having everything where it belongs means the kids can easily find the toys they want and make the most of them.


Dialogue practice


how do you keep your house so spick and span?


Oh I spent a few weeks cleaning it out


really


yes I got rid of anything we don't need.


I should really get around to doing that sometime


cleaning up the house got me thinking that I should only buy things I really need.
