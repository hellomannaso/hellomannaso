Talk about knitting easy to follow and detailed instructions for knitting are available online so it's a good hobby to have a go at these days. 
I knit whenever the weather gets cold. 
It's been three years since I first picked up knitting and I complete at least two pieces each year.

You can make all sorts of things including accessories like scarves, hats and bags

as well as clothing like cardigans and vests. 
Last year I knitted a vest and a hat for my 6 year old son. 
It was very moving to see my son wearing something I had made with my own two hands. 
This year I'm planning to make a sweater for my husband.
