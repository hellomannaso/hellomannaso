Wednesday April 26th talk about being a fan girl or fan boy I am a real fan girl. 
These days the person I'm a fan of is actor Yeon wujin. 
I saw him in a tv show this spring and it was love at first sight. 
So I joined a fan club for the first time in my life

and I am active online. 
I'm also having a good time posting photos and notes on social media about him. 
I surprised myself with such girlish sensibilities at my age but not everyone approves. 
That's why I'm trying to live more productively to be more confident in my fan girl activities.

Being a fan girl has become a tonic for my life. 
It gives me new energy and makes me take charge of my life. 
It even made me write in to Ipu young the program I love so much taking all of this together I think that being a fan girl really has a lot of advantages.
