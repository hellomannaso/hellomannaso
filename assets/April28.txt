Friday April 28th talk about earphones. 
Ever since I was young I have been accustomed to listening to something on earphones. 
I've also got used to wireless earbuds at some point so I don't have to deal with the hassle of tangled cables. 
Wireless earbuds are on the pricey side.

They might have an unstable connection and the audio quality isn't as good as you'd find on wired devices. 
But despite all that their biggest selling point is the freedom of movement they provide. 
Of course there are people who still insist on using wired earphones because of their analog charm.

I love the freedom of movement I get from wireless earbuds but it's so easy to misplace one. 
That's right they don't come cheap so I can't just buy another pair.
