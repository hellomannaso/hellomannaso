Tuesday April 25th talk about your efforts to become more physically flexible. 
Everyone knows someone who is physically flexible most of those people are born with. 
But flexibility is also something that can be gained through effort. 
I was born stiff

growing old with such a stiff body I eventually got a herniated disk. 
I was suffering from back pain when I read somewhere that doing the splits can help alleviate the pain. 
So for two years, I stretched my legs on a daily basis. 
Thanks to these efforts, my back pain has gotten much better.

Plus many people remark on how flexible I am. 
I am glad I put in all the hard work. 
Dialogue, practice
