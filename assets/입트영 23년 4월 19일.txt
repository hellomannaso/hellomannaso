talk about the joys of studying in a rural area. 
Last winter I happened to come across an agricultural study program. 
It's a program that lets city kids visit schools in rural areas for 6 to 12 months experiencing the country life.

My son was in second grade at the time and I asked him how he felt about studying in a rural area. 
He watched the promo video and immediately said that he was very interested in going. 
So my son transferred to a school in Jeollanam Do province.

The house my son and I are staying at is a five minute drive from the school. 
When my son steps outside he communicates with the local elders and neighborhood friends. 
He's learning how to share even the little things. 
We will have to return to Seoul next January
